FIX: Sign-up error - removed undefined SessionManager and RateLimiter references

- Fixed registration API failing due to undefined SessionManager.getSessionContext()
- Removed RateLimiter.recordSuccess() call that was not imported
- Registration now completes successfully
- Users can now sign up without errors
- Kept SyncService validation which is properly imported

This fixes the "Sign-up Error: An error occurred during sign-up" issue
